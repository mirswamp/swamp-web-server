### About the SWAMP

The Software Assurance Marketplace (SWAMP) is a joint effort of four
research institutions -- the Morgridge Institute for Research, Indiana
University, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and the
University of Wisconsin-Madison -- to advance the capabilities and increase
the adoption of software assurance technologies through an open continuous
assurance facility. The SWAMP originally went live in February 2014 as a web
application at <https://www.mir-swamp.org>, where it provides continuous
software assurance capabilities to developers and researchers.

The SWAMP project is funded by the Department of Homeland Security Science
and Technology Directorate.
