###SWAMP Background

The Software Assurance Marketplace is a joint effort of four research institutions – the Morgridge Institute for Research, Indiana University, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison – to advance the capabilities and to increase the adoption of software assurance technologies through an open continuous assurance facility. The SWAMP project is funded by the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate and went live in February 2014 at <https://www.mir-swamp.org>.
